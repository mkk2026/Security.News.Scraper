# Palette's Journal

## 2024-05-22 - Initial Setup
**Learning:** UX consistency requires a shared journal of learnings.
**Action:** Created this journal to track UX patterns and accessibility insights.

## 2024-05-22 - Search Shortcuts
**Learning:** Users expect `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) to focus search bars in modern web apps. Adding a visual hint that hides on input maintains cleanliness while aiding discoverability.
**Action:** Implemented `Cmd+K` shortcut with a conditionally rendered visual hint (`<kbd>`) in the search input.
