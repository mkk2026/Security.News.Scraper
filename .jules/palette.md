## 2025-02-18 - Search Input Shortcuts
**Learning:** Search inputs are a primary navigation tool in this dashboard. Users expect `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` to focus them quickly.
**Action:** Always add `Cmd+K` listener and a visual `⌘K` hint to global search inputs. Ensure the hint hides when text is entered to avoid clutter.
